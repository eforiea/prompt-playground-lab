# 🔬 Prompt Playground Lab

A Python-based playground for experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs), studying prompt behavior, and evaluating responses through the OpenRouter API.

This project was built as part of my **AI Security Bootcamp** to better understand how LLMs process prompts before moving into topics such as RAG, AI Agents, Prompt Injection, and AI Guardrails.

# 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eforiea/prompt-playground-lab.git
cd prompt-playground-lab
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

**Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux/macOS**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```


Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

This project uses the **[NVIDIA: Nemotron 3 Super (free)](https://openrouter.ai/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free)** provided by OpenRouter.

To get an API key:

1. Create an account on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).
2. Generate a new API key.
3. Paste it into your `.env` file. 

Run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

# 🧪 Prompt Testing

The project supports automated prompt evaluation.

Create test cases inside:

```text
test_case.json
```

Each test case contains a system prompt and a user prompt.

The application automatically:

* Sends all test cases
* Collects responses
* Saves the results to

```text
test_result.json
```

This makes it easy to compare model behavior across different prompts and models.

# 📊 Context Information

The playground can display useful conversation statistics:

* Number of user messages
* Number of assistant messages
* Approximate context length

This helps visualize how conversation history grows over time.
